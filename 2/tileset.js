// A tileset (also known as spritesheets) is a single image file that contains sub-images. 
// The sub-images represent all the graphics you want to use in your game.

// Storing and accessing all your game graphics on a tileset is a very processor and memory efficient 
// way to work with graphics, and Pixi is optimized for this.

// You can capture a sub-image from a tileset by defining a rectangular area that's the same size and 
// position as the sub-image you want to extract.
