start with Snake.ts

take a default start_length, size;
declare color, dir, parts, partPos etc...

In Snake1 and Game1, we drew the snake.

Added keyMap in Game2 for directions.

We then create :
    
    private readonly inverseDir = {
        [Directions.UP]: Directions.DOWN,
        [Directions.DOWN]: Directions.UP,
        [Directions.LEFT]: Directions.RIGHT,
        [Directions.RIGHT]: Directions.LEFT,
    }

because we want to prevent snake moving in opposite direction while in motion.
So in keyDown we add:

        if (lastDir && lastDir != this.inverseDir[this.snake.dir as Directions]) {
            this.snake.dir = lastDir as Directions;
        }


Now we'll make the snake crawl in part3.

in part4, we made the snake of Sprite instead of Graphics, i.e. we made it out of an image of beads.
and also performed collision detection.

We then want that snake eats itself whenever it collides with self.
