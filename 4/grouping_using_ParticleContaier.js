// Pixi has an alternative, high-performance way to group sprites called a ParticleContainer (PIXI.particles.ParticleContainer). 
// Any sprites inside a ParticleContainer will render 2 to 5 times faster than they would if they were in a regular Container. 
// Itâ€™s a great performance boost for games.

// Create a ParticleContainer like this:

// >> let superFastSprites = new PIXI.particles.ParticleContainer();
// Then use addChild to add sprites to it, just like you would with any ordinary Container
