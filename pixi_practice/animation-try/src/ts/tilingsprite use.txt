We've now used TilingSprite.
these are background of our snake/car.
snake/car is still created using createImage function.
snake/car is static and the rest of the background(i.e TilingSprites) are moving.
We create a container called background and ADD all the TilingSprites to it.
We're going to stage this background only.

TilingSprite takes texture as primary input, and width and height as optional inputs.

We make the corresponding changes in update function to move the background.

Texture<Resource> means texture as a type resource.
